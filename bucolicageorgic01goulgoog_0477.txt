receiving the share, divides into two parts, also set in an acute angle.
The most obvious interpretation of draptfei...dorro, would be that
this was a double-furrowed plough, 01 worked with two ahares3 but
consideri the weigbt of tbe toul described, and the increased re·

sistance, ffsuch had been its construction, this solution of the difficulty
does not seem probable, and indeed has never been proposed. anm
[dorsi 1] niuemque eminet aaa is the explanation of Servius: but which

throws no light. Martyn speaks of two legs, one of 11111111 was fast-
ened 10 the bottom of the tail, the other nailed to the beam: this is
not clearly explained, but is adopted by lieyne apparently without
comprehendiug it: in no sense could this be termed duplas dorsum. Aa
the ltalian plough-share appears 10 be more in a wedge form, and
therefore in its morament to create greater friction than oum, it will
require to be more strongly set. The duplex 1101111111 may therefore
mean a double 11011, 01 ground, in which the share is fixed, not standing
diagonally, aa seems tn be Martyn’s meaning, nor perpendicularly,
butat some few inches distance one immediately above the other,
horizontulty. Though this seems the must simple, indeed literal ex·
plication of tbe term in the text, it ia by no means stated with conh-
dence.

And the light lime-trae is cut down beforehand for the yolre, and tha
tall beech for the plough-staff, which may direct the machine from
rannulfi-cmm: this term has led Servius, and¹ after him uther
commentatore, to represent Virgil's as a sabael-plough, not a swiug·
plough: this is not a probable supposition. Whilst such minute di·
rectione are given for collacting aad preparing the other materiata,
that portion of them in the workmaaship and form of which most
