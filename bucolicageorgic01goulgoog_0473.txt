20. Siluano, cupressum: this deity of the woods, Ecl. x. 24. is repre·
seuted holding a young cypress tree plucked up by the rnots. Μ.

21. Deaeque mana: aster the special invocation os certain divinitus,
the poet proceeds, in conformity to the established ritual ol' the priests,
lo invoke generally every divinity, supposed to talne an interestin sarm·
ing. Os these several, each ol' whom presided osser some one peculias
operation io husbandry, are enumerated by Servius.

22. Non ullo.- ‘and you who take care os tbe new fruita which are
produced uusown, without culture.'

24. Tuque oded: ‘and you also, OCaesar.’ The interpretation of
this adverb giren by Servius, and adopted by the Delphin, is praecipue a
but in this passage, and in verses 94 and 287, oded seems to mean,
‘also, besides! To be construed in this, order: lisque oded, Censor,
prem ert incertum pure concillo deonna sint habitura rnen: velisne inrd-
rrre urbia crurumque habere terrarum, et rrrnthn orbis accipiat te, dcc.

95. inuisere: this verb ia applied to that protection which one ot
the gods had bestowed on a certain country or city: the poet supposes
hia new divinity may become one os those termed ararobgrr.

28. Maternd . . . . myrto: the myrtle was sacred rovecestram whom ,
Caesar Octavianus claimed descent. Ecl. vii. 62.

30. Thule: this island is situated, according to Pythias, at the dis·
lance of six days' sall to the north from Britain, and near the frozen
sea: prlobaiblys, thtepelpre,1 it was some part os N orway, theu considered

lation wouldclose. ,

33. Erigonen... .reqnenter: Virgo, in the zodiuc, is Erigone. The
Chaldeao astronomers made but elenen signs. The projecting claws

os the Scorpion held the balance. 0r.tttet.u.1uen; these, retracted,

the poet proposes shall afford space sor the new sign. Serv. By ordene,

and jaretd plus parte, the poet represents the eagerness and impatience ¹

with which the Scorpion, ipse, r ot'hia orvn accord, has drawn haclr his

nlaws, in order to give room, and more than sufficient roam, to the r

new luminary.’
43. Vere nono: the subject of the first bools is now taken up by
describing tha praeesses preceding sarving.
44. Putris: ‘'and the crumbling soil unhinds itself by the west wind’
48. Bis qua . . ..erariis this passage is generally interpreted to mean

sourploughings ς two given in the winter orearlyspring‚ and two during t

the summer. N ο such wonderful result could be promised from this
processione ordinary sallow. More probably, that which the poet
has in view, ts the tilluge where land, alter hearing its crnp, before 44

is subjected to another, has received the sun’sinlluence during tren os its 1

revolutione, traice undergone the summer’s heat,and larice, the winter’a ¹
cold; or, as it is technically called, had turn clennsnllorns. ln some rare
instances, where the preceding husbandry has been foul, this practice
may now be necettary, and a very productiva crop may certainly be

expected.
