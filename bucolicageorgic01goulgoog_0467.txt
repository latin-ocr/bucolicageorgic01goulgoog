ECLOGUEIX.

Tne soldier, to whom Virgil's patrimony had been assigned, did not
acquiesce in his resumption os ad bnt attacked him. sword in hand.
With difficulty the poet escaped, aad proceeded to iturae in ordor to
obtain redress. at this tinne, the present Eclogue appears to lrave
been written: lt is wholly dramatical. Lycidas, one ol' tho interlocu-
tors‚ overtaldng llloeris, the other, on the road to lllantna, carrying
kids, inquires the object of his journey. This gives¹ him anapporln·
nlty to recount the wrong done his master, illan-<vicari some os whose
poetical effusione are recited by each ol the interlocutors. (rae
situation of Menalcas, as itis represented in this Eclogue, and that of
vingit himself, have these points ol similarlly: ist, The savour
done: ed, The subseqnent violence: sd, Varus, Virgit's lrieod, in-
vcked: ath, The divine honours applied to the memory ol Julius
Cacsar: to which may be added, oth, the identity ol the situation os
the sarm ol Menalcas, and ol that which appears to have been Virgil's-
within ashort wallr os lllanlua, and close to the water. ln that situation,
Virgil atierwards, Geo. iii. 13, ld, vows to erect a temple to his bene·
factor. The localily is described in this Eclogne with circumstances ¹
so minute, as to appear intended for a representation os the real tand-
scape: on the acclivity of a hill; from the loot os the mountain to
the water, arod to a shattered bcech. or row oi those trees. ,

This Eclogue may be considered as wholly occasionslfhastily pre·
pared by intorweaving fragments os other poema, and offered to Varus
iu the place ola supplication that the favour might be confirmed
which had already been bestowed on the poet.
