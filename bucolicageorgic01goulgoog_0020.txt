PBHACE·

These were arnong the first considerationsin publishing this
edition of Virgil. lt was believed, also, thata more correct
text dian any'in common use might be put into the hands of
learners, by publishing in a ular form thet which isthe result
of the combined labours of eyne‚ Heinsius, Burmann, Wakefield,
and others. Such is the text now offered to the youthful student
of Vugil. lt is substantially Hcyne’s, which is undoubted-
ly the most perfect text extant, but with such slight varia.
tions as a careful collatino of the abovementioned authorities
seemed to recommend. lt is printed from Didot's stereotype
edition. Audit isconfidently believed, should any ursa-uetera
examine the work, who have hitherto been confined to the use
of the Delphin text, that they will in this find menyperplex-
ities and stumblingblocks removed· ’ «ι

ln preparing the Notes, free use hasbeen made of all the
materiale within the editor's resch. In all cases, where it could
consistentiy be done, the authority has been given, except where
dre notes of lllr. Valpy’s edition have been adopted. These,
as his own remarks are frequently blended with other author-
ities, have not been particularly designated. The notes of
the learned 1. H. Voss were first made Engl‘mh for tlrut edi·
tion, to which notes this is likewise indebted. The notes are

student’s reach. ln the vest variety of materiale Fpresented, it

has been found difficolt to be sufficiently concise. or it is easy
to say much u'pon Virgil, but difficult to say a little to the point.
Boys will not voluntarily read long notes, even intheir vernaculas
tonguc 3 much lessina foreign lengun e. But, when embarrass-
ed, they will seek relief from notes, ii they are short

As no boy should be permitted to read Virgil without being
able to scan every verse before he reads it, it was thought advis-
able to subjoin alist of the most difficolt verses with the method
of scanning eacl1; es this will save the teacher from frequent
interruptione while the student is reparing sor recitation. 'llre
authority of Dr. Corey has been lirllowed inthe Metrical Key.
A few questions lrave also been added, at the suggestion of some
of our most respectable instructas, which may expedite the la·
bour of the teacher in ascertnining whether the pupil has oon·
sulted his notes and his Classical Dictionary, and lead to a
more connected and definite view of the subject than the pupil
wordd otherwise obtain.
