55. Frigus· m:oprreusr ‘coolness in the thade'

54. Hinc. . ..smrror the sentence may be thus placed: Hine seper,
a limite uicinaque seraper deputa est quod ad florus salicti Hyblaia
opibus, sepi leui sussum suadebit tibi inire smum. A boundary
hedge is planted with vitrove: ιο these tlre bees reson, whose gendo
humming lulls ιο sleep. The epithet, Hyblaean, is applied ιο thess on
ι account os the superior qbality oi the honey produced in that district

57. Fraudator: in order ιο aesist the ripeuing oi the grapa, he is
represented as clearing away the leaves, and pruning. See Geo. ii. 400.
-Act ouras: ‘to tho breones?

⁵3. Teucera: ‘your favourites ς’ tae euru Lycoris. Ecl. x. 22.

62. Aera.- Tityrus expresses the extent ol' his obligation, which he
novercari surget-Pereuntia .. . finibus: each people, passing their osvo
boundary, shall occupy the other’s country. This could only be
etiected ογ the previous conquestos the Romans, whose territory in·

this (sucurrones. -

63 . . ..tin Ararim... Tigrin: the names ol' rivers flowing in distant .
regions, could οοι, as has been observed, be familiar to an Italian
pensant: possibly, ior this reason, his geography has been ,made pur·
posoly incorrect. Parthia proper, bounded Ν. ογ the Caspian, Ε. ογ
Bactriana, S· by the deserte oi Caramania, W. by Media, was separated
ογ the latter country, and by part of Syria, liom the Tigris.⁸ On tho
other hand, rhe Arar, now the Saone, is a river os Gaul, and joina the

k Rheno, near the present city os Lyons. To this it hae been replied,

thartha Parthians might, and did in lact, malse inroads and conquesta
as sar as tho Tigris, and the Germana, as sar as the Saone: though
these rivere were not within their territory, respectively, yet thoy
dowed in countrios which each had conquered.

65. Afros: the proposition omitted; according to the Greek idiom.
bleliboeus proceeds to contrast his own and his follow exiles’ fate ιο

66. (οπο... Oarrrrt: hleliboeus speaks oi his expelled countrynren
as destined to vander in countrios at the extremities os the earth.
Crete could hardly be rechoned among these: yet in thar island, a
town named Oaxis is twice mentioned by Herodotus, iv. and from that
town, Apollonius Rhodius, and Varro, as cited ογ Servius, take epitheta
sor the island ς no sufficient prooi, indeed, appears that any river thero
ever bore this appellation. Servius thinks the Orus,a Bactrian river,
is meant; and that erra, signifies the ‘challs,' ot· ‘white clay,’ by which
its stream was discoloured. Adflumrn Oanos peremtum est: iric, quia,
limum uehit, turbidus semper et insalubris potu. Quint. Curt. vii. 10.
Though rapidum crete, is an unusual idionr, the interpretation ο.
Servius is adopted by Voss. No passage in the Eclogues has given
birth ιο rnore debete, and it nrust romain in considerable doubt. “
