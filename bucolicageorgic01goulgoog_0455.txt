on whose birth the poet makes these miracles depend, is extremely
doubtful. ln that year Caesar Octavianus married Scribonia3 and in

soon to have a child, was married to Maris Autony. She nas the
pledge of peace between her brother and husband3 her child, when
born, might be viewed ns destined to high fontaneo, and vvas indeed
the Marcellus whose marnory is immortalized ia thedth AEn. ln
