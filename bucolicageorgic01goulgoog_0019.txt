ir any one cause has operated more than every other to
prevent young men from acquiring efres and easy manner of
reading the Latin poets, it unquestionably ls the habit of using an
order of commanem, or an rnnrpretarwn. The use of these
perricious helps not only prevents those who rely on thern from

κ ever acquiring the power of reading with ease and pleasnre

without them, but it is utterly subversive of one of the principnl
objects of studying the lanyrrage, that mental discipline which is
acquired by the practice o critical and exact analysis. This
salutary influence, the use of an order or of an interpretation
effecwally counteracts.

The student will hardly take the paine of disentangling an

mulcete sentence when the work is done tobis hand3 nor will
¹ the test of grammatical construction or of prosody be applied,
ἱ when e glauce at the interpretat-ion will remove all doubts. The

babit of titus referrin to the judgrnent of others soon becomes
settled; while that oianalysing is never formed, nor the'discipline
of mind acquired, which it is suited to effect. Besides this,
the habit of usin these unnecessary aida prevents that feeling
ot self-reliance w 'ch successful efforts alone can secure.

To this cause we must attribute the fact, that so lew among
our educated men read the Latin poets with ease or pleasure.
But if the babit of readin independently of foreign assistance be
once formed, the want oisuch assistance is not felt. lt is found

lpy experienca that boys, who have been taught in this wa , pead
orace and Juvenal as readrly as they do Cicero and acrtus;

and even with more confidence 3 since in poetry they ere urnish·
ed hy prosody with an unerring test for resolving many doubts,
· while in prose they have no such aid.

These ere not new views. Boolm sumished with these aux-
iliaries are going out of use in the best schools in foreign coun-
tries. 'Ihirty years ago the le'srned and practicel Vicesimus
