allerwards addressed the tenth Eclogue3 as also a passage in the fourth
book 01 the Georgica, which, ou his disgrace with Augustus, Virgil was
obliged to omit

66. Assurres‘irit: the author 01 the dialogus, De Orat. ascribed to
Tacitus, says, tlret iu the theatra at Rome, the same compliment was .
paid to Virgil himself: Testis ipse popalus, qui audilis in tlrrotro oer-
silms Virgilii, sancxit universus, ct sorti presentem specierumque Vrs-
gth'mn veneratus est, sic qudm Arrgrrstros. 11300110157. London

70. screa seni: Hcsiod, whose birthplsce was Ascrae, 0 town in
Boeotia.,.lllosoe dont tibi, OGalle, los calamos, en accipe eos, quos dede·
ruat anti seni Ascrae. .

73. Grynei: Strabo, confirmed hy Pausanias, tixes the situation 01
Grynium iu nitetis, aad places there a* temple and grove dedicated ro

73. Jactet Apollo: Euphorion, a poet 01 Chalcis, had written a poem
on the origin 01 eracles l Ecl. x.50.), including thet 01 Grynium. Gallus

71. Scyllam Nisi: this is a disputad passage: Quid loquar, rrt 110110
serit Scyllam Nisi filiani, quom forna secuta est succinctam quod ad
condida inguina, ac. Virgil is thus made to ascribe to the daughter
01 Nisus the transformatiou which Scylla, the daughter ol Phorcus,
uuderwent. Other poets, it is truc, have in the samo manner blended
1110 two lables:

Quid miron: in patrios, Scyllam, sevisse capillos,
Candidaque in saevos inguine versa cenes. Propert. ir. 4.

But the story 01 Scylla, the daughter 01 Nisus, is elsewhere stated hy
Virgil, Geo. 11011 it is therefore not probable that hc would here
conlound her with another Scylla: unless, as Cerdo supposes, both
were labled to be transformed into seadogs.
