lt· can hardly be supposed that any youtlt will commence the study
os tlte AEneid who has not previously acquired some knowledge ol
tllpe history ot the siege ol Troy, and ol the circumstances which led to
tatevent?

It will be remembered that all the states ol Greece united in ona
common cause to evange the insult offered to Menelaus, king ol Sparta,
by Paris, the son os Priam, king ol Troy. Paris had bean hospitably
entertained at the court os Menelaus, but abused this hospitalityby
eloping with Helen, the wila ol his bost, whose affectione hebed
treachorously gained, aod whom he carried with him tu Troy. Alter
a siege os ten years the city was taken and destroyed hythe Greeks.
A lew ol the Trojans, who escaped, under tlte guidance ot' AEneas, son Χ
of Anchises and Venus, sailed from Asia in quest of a new settlement. l
With au account os these, aster they had survived many toils and dau·
gers. in the seventh year of their wanderings, the poet opens the subject
ol his poem, verse 34. lo the words ol Mr. Addison, ‘ AEneas makes
his first appearance in the Tyrrhena sens, aad within sight ol Italy,
because the action proposed to ho celebrated was that os his settling
himself ia Latium.

‘But because it was'necessary lor the reader to know what had hap·
pened to himin the taking ol Troy, and in the preceding parts oi his
voyage, Virgil makes lris hero relate it,by way ol episode, in the second
and third books ot‘ the AEneid3 the contenta ol both which books come
before those ol tlte first book, in tlte thread ol the story3 though, sot
prescrving tlte unity ol action, they follow them in the disposition ol
the. oem!

Tlie seur verses, which in some manuscripts appear prefixed to tlte
AEneid, are considered hy the best commentatore as spurious, and in·
consistent with tlte digaity os the Epic blase.
